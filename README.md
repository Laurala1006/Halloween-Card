# Halloween-Card
This SwiftUI project demonstrates my ability to create interactive and animated user interfaces for iOS applications. The Halloween-themed app provides an engaging experience by combining animations, gestures, and visual effects.

Key Features:

● Animated Background:

A smooth linear gradient combined with a semi-transparent leaf texture creates a festive Halloween atmosphere.

● Interactive Images:

A master character image appears or disappears with a scaling animation when tapping the themed button.

A bat image that users can drag around the screen or auto-fly to a designated position with smooth animation.

● Animated Text Effects:

The "Happy Halloween" text supports rotation and scaling animations, creating a dynamic greeting.

● Gesture Handling:

The bat image responds to drag gestures, allowing users to move it freely on the screen.

● Custom Buttons with Icons:

Three stylized circular buttons, each triggering different animations or effects.

Button icons are Halloween-themed and neatly framed with orange stroke borders for visual consistency.

● Smooth Animations:

Leveraging withAnimation and .easeInOut to achieve seamless transitions and engaging motion effects.
